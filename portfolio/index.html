        <h1>How did I end up here?</h1>
        

        <p> Sometimes in life you have to work in a company that you cant stand just to pay your bills.
            During my younger years I studied hard and passed my exams getting ten <b>GCSEs</b> and four <strong>A levels</strong> and went on to study Geology at Univeristy of Leeds.
            Sometimes life throws you a curve ball and me and my now wife but girlfriend at the time found ourselves with a beautiful daughter, eighteen years ago.
            Due to the need to feed my young family I went from dead end job to dead end job just to provide and struggled to do this.  Fithteen years ago my son was born 
            and I kind fo landed on my feet with a job that pays very well, has a lot of days off, but is terrible for my health as there are fumes such as <i>Hydrogen cyanide</i> 
            also night shifts and unsociable hours are killing me.  So at the grand old age of 41 now my kids are 18 and 15, I have a bit of spare time and now is that time 
            to get myself out of this job and into a career where I'm not working nights and breathing in poisonous gasses in my 50s and 60s. <em>The HNC, HND and eventually degree 
            are my plan to acheive this. </em>

        </p>

        <h1>How Do I Plan to do This</h1>
        <p> So I need to learn how to be Ethical with computing, design some small scale stand alone applications, Introduce myself to some SQL, Develop some software, Design some 
            databases, Troubleshoot some computer problems and learn some computer system fundamentals. This is the first semester of my HNC at uhi.

            <p> The University of the Highlands and Islands is a tertiary university composed of Academic Partners which are the 13 colleges and research institutions in the
                Highlands and Islands of Scotland delivering higher education. Its executive office is in the former Royal Northern Infirmary building in Inverness

             <h2>Students quotes</h2>   
             
             
                 <p>"Teaching on the degree programme varies between face-to-face teaching, video-based teaching, self-directed study, and clinical skills sessions with 
                patients to learn and develop our practical skills so there really is something to suit everyoneâ€™s learning needs. We all have our own personal academic tutors,
                who we can contact about any troubles we might be having, and we also have regular one-to-one meetings with them. All our tutors are there for support and are only an email 
                away whenever we need them".</p>

                 <p>"I loved the fact that you could study at a campus, and from home, and at the same time be networked with the university's thirteen campuses across the beautiful 
                 Highlands and Islands. This degree combines three of my main interests: Scotland, history and politics, and has taught me invaluable academic skills. I have continued with the 
                 university by progressing onto the MLitt British Studies."</p>
